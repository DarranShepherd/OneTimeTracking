1.0.5.1:

- Selecting a Harvest Project will default the Harvest Task to "Development" if such task exists in the project
- Added ability to search for a Target Process Story and Task by ID
     - Open the relevant box, type # followed by the ID and wait until the data is populated. There is a 1000ms delay from last character typed
- Added Target Process Bugs to list of Tasks for User Stories that have them. Time will be logged against User Story and not the bug itself
- Combine will now remember the last Harvest Project you selected for a Target Project. This means logging will be a lot quicker. To change the default simply log a time against the Target Process Project with a different Harvest Project and the default will be overwritten
- Users can now log time directly against a Target Process User Story, without the need to select a Task. This is mainly for Tech Leads that are helping on a project
- Changed the logo
- Renamed the extension to Combine
- Changed the "Visit Harvest" link to go directly to the timesheet
- Remove "Toggle spinners" button
